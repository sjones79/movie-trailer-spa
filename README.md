# Movie Trailer Single Page Application

Simple coding project to vet development skills.  

### Coding Challenge Description

Find a few movie trailers from youtube and build a responsive single page application that utilizes Youtube Iframe API. You are allowed to use bootstrap and no other CSS or JavaScript frameworks.  You need to include a responsive navigation menu that when clicked, changes the movie title and description displayed.

### The Approach

* Find a barebones bootstrap template that reflected a typical photo gallery.
* For the navigation, create a few movie categories to choose from
* For each of the movie categories, pick a few good movies with decent youtube trailers
* Create a landing page movie for each category and switch between the movies that were clicked through
* Make the youtube video responsive so it would scale between devices.


### Timeline

The project was due within 3 business days, so it is considered an MVP, not production ready.  The styling is very basic, enough to be aesthetically tolerable but hardly beautiful.
